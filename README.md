For running of that program which will deploy your container on local machine you will need:
-- Preinstalled Docker.io("sudo apt get docker.io", "sudo yum install docker.io", etc) 
-- Preinstalled and configured Git. Git should be in your PATH. SSH key's should works. Your name and e-mail should be configured ("sudo apt install git", "sudo yum install git", etc)
